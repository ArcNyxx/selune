selune - selections manager
===========================
selune is a utility to capture and distribute data via x selections.

Requirements
------------
selune requires libxcb and libxcb-icccm to build.

Installation
------------
selune comes with a Makefile and config.mk file for configurable building and
testing.  Edit the latter to match your local setup (selune is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default, you may need to modify your $PATH).

selune can be built and installed with the following command (run as root):

    make clean install


Notes
-----
Using the INCR property type mechanism for exceptionally large data transfers
is not properly implemented.  A pull request remedying any protocol errors
would be appreciated.
